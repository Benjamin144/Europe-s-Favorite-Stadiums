Initial idea

Elite Football Stadiums then World Stadiums then European Stadium Tours I realized that a solution to the idea is impacted by COVID 19 because of major impact on travel. Therefore the site could be for information purposes for now, but I wanted to use the idea to explore my learning and make the site interactive.

The original idea came from a distant admiration for major architecture in general and exclusively in sport and the history of arenas used across the world since time began.

The first idea was to build the Worlds Elite Football Stadiums app - (WEFS) or Elite League Football Grounds.

The idea was to create a website which lists all of this years Champions League Football Grounds information. Then use the Google's api as a ground locator.

The code would then attempt to split the locations into Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western European regions which would aid in the use of easy travel optimization.

In graphical terms this would look like a simple circle that splits into four zonal perimeters. This format then allows the user to click on each zonal area to reveal the information about the football ground location and it's amenities, i.e. capacity, parking, access points so on and so forth.

Further development would engage upon using the current statistical trends to predict which teams will make up the new World Elite League that is under current discussion.

There would then have to be a method of storing the information of all stadiums in Europe and a way to retrieve the data when an upcoming event occurs in the future champions league scenarios.

Finalizing the idea

Solving a business problem
I then realized that this concept might not stoke the interests of the public at large. So I thought why not increase the scope and development to all types of sporting arenas across Europe and then make the app a travelling companion called World Stadium Tours - This might solve a business problem geared towards the Hospitality industry.
I would then go on to build a three page site
1st page - Landing with optional Register - Sign in and search functionality
2nd page - Table format of 26 clickable sporting disciplines (has navigation button to go back to previous page)
3rd page - information which highlights a stadium venue to the left, stats and info to the right and google api features on the bottom. This also has a navigation button to go a=back to the previous page and also a forward button for the next stadium venue. The 2nd and 3rd pages will also have a home button to navigate back to the Landing page
